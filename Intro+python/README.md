# Computer-Vision-1
This is an online course as part of an opencv.org course bundle. I am using Jupyter to interact with Python. To write code, I use VS Cose as an additional editor. 

( So I make a distinction between those, if I need to explore some data, try out an algorithm, visualize  something, jupyter is a great place to do that. If I need to write a bunch of classes, write test  cases, for those generally I will use an editor).
